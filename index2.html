	<p> At sourcED we believe that everyone is capable of success. Now it's just a matter of whether they have access to the resources that will propel them froward into the future. So we are here to combat that problem.  We want everyone student to get a fair shot at having the future they want. We want to give them access to the resources that they are bereft from. How do we do that? By bringing awareness! Everyone deserves to know that prep program that's happening at this library or that fun afterschool program. So here's our promise to you. We will make you aware of the opportunities happening around your community and you will also have your own mentor/buddy, usually highschool or college student, that will guide you and explore with you these opportunities that we have assembled for you. You, in turn, have to promise us that you will take full advantage of these resources and continue to succeed. If you succeed then we succeed in our mission.
